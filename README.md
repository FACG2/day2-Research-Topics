# Technical spikes

## What are technical spikes?
Technical spike is the investigation to drive out risk and uncertainty. It comes from Extreme Programming (XP) and is a great way for the team to:

  **1. Reduce the risk of a technical problem.**

  **2. Increase the reliability of a user story’s estimate.**
  
>Extreme programming (XP) ?is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

Sometimes a user story is generated that cannot be well estimated until the development team does some actual work to resolve a technical question or a design problem. The solution is to create a “spike,” which is some work whose purpose is to provide the answer or solution.

>“If you develop one solution for a problem, it’s a trap. Two possible solutions is a dilemma — which one do I choose? Once I have three solutions, I often have more insight into the entire problem, and I can generate more choices. I might not need more than three choices" — Johanna Rothman

## When to do technical spike

The purpose of a spike is to gain the knowledge necessary to reduce the risk of a technical approach, better understand a requirement, or increase the reliability of a Story estimate.

**1. Your team is having trouble estimating stories effectively. There are many wildly different opinions on the size of user stories. Consider a spike and rely on expert opinion instead of consensus based estimation like Planning Poker.**

**2. The story point estimate is unrealistically high, to sandbag FUD — fear, doubt and uncertainty. Use technical spike to dispel FUD, then estimate.**


## HOW TO ENTER A SPIKE

If the spike only takes, say, an hour or two, maybe we don’t need to track it in our ALM(Application Life-cycle Management) tool. If it’s larger than that, you should enter it into your backlog.

#### How would Product Owner write up a spike?

The cocky answer is to say “make your tech lead enter it”.

** A more serious answer would be that the technical story format would be good:**

In order to
`<achieve some goal>`  `<a system or persona>` needs to <some action>.
<br /><br />
Example: In order to split the collection curve wizard story, the tech lead needs to do some detailed design. (Just enough to split the story.) <br /><br />
Example: In order to estimate the “user connection report” story, the tech lead and PO need to research capabilities of MSTR and have some conversations with the PO. (Just enough to estimate the story.)
I like to start the name or title with “SPIKE:” to make them stand out in the **ALM**(Application Life-cycle Management) tool. Using a tag or a label could work as well.
TIME-BOX YOUR SPIKES
Teams should agree that every spike is, say, never more than 1 day of research. (For some teams this might be, say, 3 days, if that’s the common situation.) At the end of the time-box, you have to report out your findings. That might result in another spike, but time-box the experiments. If you weren’t able to answer the question before time runs out, you must still report the results to the team and decide what to do next. What to do next might be to define another spike.
You might say “I think there’s a bug in the app server… there’s no way I can hear back from their support within the time-box.” The timebox is effort, not calendar time. So, the spike can be about recreating the problem and providing enough info for the support group to look into it.
It’s also best if a spike has one very clear question to answer. Not a bunch of questions or an ambiguous statement of stuff you need to look into. Therefore, split your spikes just as you would large user stories.

#### Give an example of how a spike could have helped with last week's projects.
